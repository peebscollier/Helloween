<p>You walk into the trees. And walk. And walk. Does the sun ever rise? Maybe, you can just never tell. The darkness seems eternal and you know it must have been days now. At some point you realise it has become pitch black. 
    You have walked into some kind of cardboard box. it seems like... a matchbox? Impossible. you're too big. Ah but this is a special matchbox made by a curious alien who wanted to take a 'bug' back to show his science class. That's the end for you, buggy.</p>
